\title{Thanks}

Booklit is very heavily inspired by
\link{Scribble}{https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/}, the documentation tool
for the \link{Racket programming language}{https://racket-lang.org/}. Without
it, Booklit would not exist.

The color scheme for this website is based on \link{I'm a
BookWorm}{http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/2767765/Im_a_BookWorm}.

The favicon is based on the Google Noto Emoji font, and is licensed under the
